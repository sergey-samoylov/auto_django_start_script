# AUTO DJANGO 
>>> django.sh shell script 

(major updates in v0Ô∏è‚É£.3Ô∏è‚É£)



## Starting up a Django project never has been easier

- **django.sh** checks for needed variables
- asks for the project folder/directory name

![script checks for two variables](img/1.png)

- creates needed folders

![Give name to your project directory](img/2.png)

- does all the rest

screenshot bellow is for versions upto v0.2 (upgraded in v0.3) and above

![it even edits settings.py file and registers the first app](img/3.png)

- creates crisp requirements.txt (only used packages, without dependecies, as they will be autoinstalled anyway üòâ)

## Current version v0.3

Lots of improvements.

Clean and secure settings.py.

With python-dotenv and .env variable in its due places.

Two folders are created for static and images, urls.py created for the first app.

More code-cleaning done through the script

## HOW-TO:

1. chmod +x django.sh # make it executable
1. ./django.sh name_of_your_project firstapp # do not use snake case for the firstapp yet, please
1. In a second script asks for MAIN_FOLDER_of_your_project
1. By default your project will be paced in /home/<your_username>/Dev/<MAIN_FOLDER_of_your_project>/<name_of_your_project>
1. If you need any additional apps in venv for your project, write names of the apps when asked (shoul be separated by spaces)

Current file structure v0.3
