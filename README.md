# AUTO DJANGO

## Starting up a Django project never has been easier

- **django.sh** checks for needed variables
- asks for the project folder/directory name

![script checks for two variables](img/1.png)

- creates needed folders

![Give name to your project directory](img/2.png)

- does all the rest

![it even edits settings.py file and registers the first app](img/1.png)


### What it does:

- **django.sh** installs virtual environment
- **django.sh** installs and upgrades pip
- **django.sh** installs flake8 and black
- **django.sh** edits settings.py (deletes comments, regirsters your first app)
- **django.sh** starts developer web-server of you Django project

## Enjoy!
